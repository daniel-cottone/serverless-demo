# serverless-demo

## Getting started
To begin, first make sure you have the latest version of [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) installed:
```
yarn global add serverless
```

Then, lets make sure we can easily use serverless from the command line [by setting up our AWS credentials](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md).

## Usage
Run `yarn install` in either of the demo directories to install dependencies. Then you can deploy the service to AWS
using `sls deploy`.
